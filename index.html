        <h2>Mission statement:</h2>
        <p>This website has two primary goals: firstly, it seeks to bring attention to the increasing saturation of space junk within the night sky. Secondly, it also is made with the intention of reminding you that space is cool. The final frontier, a source of endless possibilities. That is cool, and it's fun to think about as well.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="readingSection">
        <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
        <p>Space was never one of my true interests, ever since I was small I've been more of a planes and cars kind of guy, but whenever I do interact with space, it's inspiring. One of my fondest childhood memories is going to Kennedy space centre as a child, seeing a rocket launch and watching documentaries about space with my Grandparents. Because space is cool, it's exciting, and it doesn't have to be your core interest for you to find it well... interesting.</p>

            <figcaption>A picture I took with another space shuttle, at a later date.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So if this website can achieve anything, let it be inspiring you to take a few moments out of your day to say "wow, that's cool." Because space never stops being cool.</p>
