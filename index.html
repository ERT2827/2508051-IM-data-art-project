        <h2>Mission statement:</h2>
        <p>This website has two primary goals: firstly, it seeks to bring attention to the increasing saturation of space junk within the night sky. Secondly, it also is made with the intention of reminding you that space is cool. The final frontier, a source of endless possibilities. That is cool, and it's fun to think about as well.</p>

            <h2>Art:</h2>
            <p>This website includes an interactive data art piece, which utilizes the NASA Astronomical Picture of the Day API to create an experience where you can see all the wonder of the galaxy in a quick and engaging format.</p>
            <a href="/HTML/art.html">Check out the Art.</a>

            <h2>Learning:</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of this site is education, both with me teaching myself about code and with me teaching you about space and space junk. This page mainly focuses on the latter, with several helpful infomatics. In particular it focuses on the growing issue of space junk, which could be a big problem for future generations if we aren't careful.</p>

        <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
        <p>Space was never one of my main interests, ever since I was small I've been more of a planes and cars kind of guy, but whenever I do interact with space, it's inspiring. One of my fondest childhood memories is going to Kennedy space centre as a child, seeing a rocket launch and watching documentaries about space with my Grandparents. Because space is cool, it's exciting, and it doesn't have to be your core interest for you to find it well... interesting.</p>

            <figcaption>A picture I took with another space shuttle, at a later date.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So if this website can achieve anything, let it be inspiring you to take a few moments out of your day to say "wow, that's cool." Because space never stops being cool.</p>
