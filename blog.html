        <h2>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>
        <h3>What is being said:</h3>
        <p>The main reading for this blog is a chapter written Qi Li about Data Visualization. It mainly serves as a technical outline, with a particular focus being placed upon the various possible types of representation for data and also the history of data representation as a practice. There’s also an overview of the benefits of data representation, which are: Representing lots of data immediately; easier identification of patterns; easier quality control through identifying patterns; improved understanding of large- and small-scale data (Li, 2020: 18). </p><p>
            An important part of this reading is also what data visualization specifically is. Generally, when data representation is mentioned, it refers to something specific like graphs or software-based visualization, but this reading broadens those definitions by defining data visualization as “the transformation of data into information” (Li, 2020: 19). Key to this definition is the distinction between data and information. The former is defined by the reading “unprocessed information”, which becomes processed when it is assigned meaning by a human being and fed back into the system (Li, 2020: 21). </p><p>
            The reading also provides various examples of Data Visualization according to its definition, broken down into two categories. The first is information visualization, which represents abstract data in a visual way, allowing the user to extract meaning from it and therefore turn it to information. Examples given of this are Tables, Charts, Trees, Maps, Scatter-plots, Diagrams and Graphs. The second category is scientific visualization, which specifically focus on scientific data representation such as simulations, waveforms and volume to allow the drawing of conclusions from gathered data to create new information (Li, 2020: 22). </p><p>
            The last section of the reading focuses on the psychological benefits of Data Visualization through the lens of basic psychology and a more specific theory known as Preattentive Processing, which is a field of psychological study that seeks to understand how humans subconsciously process information before becoming truly aware of it (APA Dictionary, 2023). This is relevant to the reading because it is believed to be an important part of why data visualization is so effective. One of the strongest senses in a human is sight, and because of this providing visual data can help processing into information drastically (Li, 2020: 44). </p>
        <h3>What I think:</h3>
        <p>Overview of Data Visualization (Li, 2020) falls squarely into a category of readings that are vital for the theoretical framework that they provide. Having a foundation with which I can discuss and contemplate data visualization, especially when our next assignment so heavily focuses on it, should serve well going forwards. It’s also fine that the reading itself is largely surface level because it is, ultimately, just a foundation. Using this resource and the many, many other readings it cites, I can begin to build my own knowledge base to draw from going into future assignments. </p><p>
        One thing that is very nice to have from this reading is the wealth of examples it provides. Both in terms of more traditional usages like graphs and diagrams, but also with the more abstract uses, like the scientific forms of representation and the fact that geographical maps are, in fact, a form of data visualization. These examples allow me to discuss these methodologies with specific terminology and make me more aware of the types of data visualizations that exist. It even broadens my viewpoint by showing me some of the more obscure examples, which is useful because it’ll allow me to pick out more niche examples I like and wouldn’t have thought of before to use in my own projects. </p><p>
        Key to this are some strong definitions. The definitions given in this reading are concise but in depth, building that strong theoretical framework for analysis that we need as students to discuss our ideas with depth and nuance. Specifically, the definition for Data Visualization is so strong because it uses two other strong definitions, the one for data and the one for information, to construct data visualization as a process. By using this definition, I can be more aware of forms of data visualization I encounter in the wild and use them as inspiration for my own project. For example, using this definition I have come to realize that graphics/visuals used in videos are a form of data visualization. The pre-mission briefs in Ace Combat games are another interesting example, which take raw data like enemy numbers, object locations and flight routes and turn them into actionable information for the player to use in their missions. In other words, the idea of Data Visualization isn’t just something that’s exclusive to web design, instead it can be used in other mediums for the benefits of quick data visualization as well. </p><p>
        In conclusion, this reading is an excellent technical basis for further research. Because while it is neither comprehensive nor innovative, it provides a vital technical foundation for discourse and comprehension that can be built upon through further reading and engagement with the topic as the project continues.</p>
        <h3>How I plan to expand this further:</h3>
        <p>From class, I have two lines of inquiry that I wish to pursue to deepen my understanding of this topic going forward.</p><p>
            The first is a reading from Knaflic (2015), which expands upon the main reading by focusing more upon what one should or shouldn't do when creating data visualizations. Where Li discusses the basics, Knaflic discusses specifics, and between the two of them I have been able to form a more solid grasp on how to visualize data. There are also more Knaflic readings throughout the semester, which should help to expand my understanding even further as I read them.</p><p>
            The other resource I've found is Information is Beautiful. This website features numerous infographics, which all serve as great inspiration for my future work as I progress forwards with my new website for this semester. I’ve also been looking at the documentation for D3 alongside this, since using both in conjunction has allowed me to begin developing ideas for my data art piece.</p><p>
