        <h2>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>
        <h3>What is being said:</h3>
        <p>The main reading for this blog is a chapter written Qi Li about Data Visualization. It mainly serves as a technical outline, with a particular focus being placed upon the various possible types of representation for data and also the history of data representation as a practice. There’s also an overview of the benefits of data representation, which are: Representing lots of data immediately; easier identification of patterns; easier quality control through identifying patterns; improved understanding of large- and small-scale data (Li, 2020: 18). </p><p>
            An important part of this reading is also what data visualization specifically is. Generally, when data representation is mentioned, it refers to something specific like graphs or software-based visualization, but this reading broadens those definitions by defining data visualization as “the transformation of data into information” (Li, 2020: 19). Key to this definition is the distinction between data and information. The former is defined by the reading “unprocessed information”, which becomes processed when it is assigned meaning by a human being and fed back into the system (Li, 2020: 21). </p><p>
            The reading also provides various examples of Data Visualization according to its definition, broken down into two categories. The first is information visualization, which represents abstract data in a visual way, allowing the user to extract meaning from it and therefore turn it to information. Examples given of this are Tables, Charts, Trees, Maps, Scatter-plots, Diagrams and Graphs. The second category is scientific visualization, which specifically focus on scientific data representation such as simulations, waveforms and volume to allow the drawing of conclusions from gathered data to create new information (Li, 2020: 22). </p><p>
            The last section of the reading focuses on the psychological benefits of Data Visualization through the lens of basic psychology and a more specific theory known as Preattentive Processing, which is a field of psychological study that seeks to understand how humans subconsciously process information before becoming truly aware of it (APA Dictionary, 2023). This is relevant to the reading because it is believed to be an important part of why data visualization is so effective. One of the strongest senses in a human is sight, and because of this providing visual data can help processing into information drastically (Li, 2020: 44). </p>
        <h3>What I think:</h3>
        <p>Overview of Data Visualization (Li, 2020) falls squarely into a category of readings that are vital for the theoretical framework that they provide. Having a foundation with which I can discuss and contemplate data visualization, especially when our next assignment so heavily focuses on it, should serve well going forwards. It’s also fine that the reading itself is largely surface level because it is, ultimately, just a foundation. Using this resource and the many, many other readings it cites, I can begin to build my own knowledge base to draw from going into future assignments. </p><p>
        One thing that is very nice to have from this reading is the wealth of examples it provides. Both in terms of more traditional usages like graphs and diagrams, but also with the more abstract uses, like the scientific forms of representation and the fact that geographical maps are, in fact, a form of data visualization. These examples allow me to discuss these methodologies with specific terminology and make me more aware of the types of data visualizations that exist. It even broadens my viewpoint by showing me some of the more obscure examples, which is useful because it’ll allow me to pick out more niche examples I like and wouldn’t have thought of before to use in my own projects. </p><p>
        Key to this are some strong definitions. The definitions given in this reading are concise but in depth, building that strong theoretical framework for analysis that we need as students to discuss our ideas with depth and nuance. Specifically, the definition for Data Visualization is so strong because it uses two other strong definitions, the one for data and the one for information, to construct data visualization as a process. By using this definition, I can be more aware of forms of data visualization I encounter in the wild and use them as inspiration for my own project. For example, using this definition I have come to realize that graphics/visuals used in videos are a form of data visualization. The pre-mission briefs in Ace Combat games are another interesting example, which take raw data like enemy numbers, object locations and flight routes and turn them into actionable information for the player to use in their missions. In other words, the idea of Data Visualization isn’t just something that’s exclusive to web design, instead it can be used in other mediums for the benefits of quick data visualization as well. </p><p>
        In conclusion, this reading is an excellent technical basis for further research. Because while it is neither comprehensive nor innovative, it provides a vital technical foundation for discourse and comprehension that can be built upon through further reading and engagement with the topic as the project continues.</p>
        <h3>How I plan to expand this further:</h3>
        <p>From class, I have two lines of inquiry that I wish to pursue to deepen my understanding of this topic going forward.</p><p>
            The first is a reading from Knaflic (2015), which expands upon the main reading by focusing more upon what one should or shouldn't do when creating data visualizations. Where Li discusses the basics, Knaflic discusses specifics, and between the two of them I have been able to form a more solid grasp on how to visualize data. There are also more Knaflic readings throughout the semester, which should help to expand my understanding even further as I read them.</p><p>
            The other resource I've found is Information is Beautiful. This website features numerous infographics, which all serve as great inspiration for my future work as I progress forwards with my new website for this semester. I’ve also been looking at the documentation for D3 alongside this, since using both in conjunction has allowed me to begin developing ideas for my data art piece.</p><p>

        <h2>Blog Essay 2: Critical Reflection – Proposed UI and UX.</h2>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>This essay is a critical reflection upon the UI -and by extension UX- of my second semester website, which will be broken up into two halves. In the first, I will be discussing the elements that already exist in my site, and reflecting about what I think works, as well as what I think could be improved. In the second half, I will be discussing the plans that I need to implement going forwards, along with how I plan to implement them. Both will be supplemented by wireframes and images. This reflection will primarily be based on the text Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals by Cole Knaflic (2015), with additional sources being used to supplement where necessary.
        <h3>What I’ve already done:</h3>
        <p>The primary UI element I’m already using is my top bar for navigation.</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture1.png" alt="A picture of the site's top bar">

        <p>This is the most important element for navigation since it’s always present and allows the user to quickly navigate to any page of my website with ease. I think that it is mostly sufficient so far for such a simple site, but I would still like to put more links in relevant parts of my site to guide users more deliberately around the different sections of the site to specifically direct their experience. Whatever I do implement, the most important part for me is that the site follows a three click rule. Because while the rule is technically a myth (Daivee, 2017), that doesn’t deduct from the fact that it’s a useful benchmark for ease of navigation on a site, especially on something as simple as the site for this project.</p>
        <p>I also have a hamburger menu for mobile navigation:</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture2.png" alt="A picture of the site's hamburger bar for navigation">

        <p>This is a necessity, since my top bar would be massively oversized on smaller mobile devices, making the site incredibly unpleasant to navigate. I do feel as though my menu could use some work to get it looking more congruent with the rest of the site, but I have yet to be struck by any inspiration on how one could do that.</p>
        <p>Even though I am yet to fully implement the data visualizing aspects of my site (or as Li would put it, the parts of my site that turn data into information (2020)), I do have some preattentive elements already.</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture3.png" alt="A picture of the site's home page, highlighting preattentive elements">

        <p>The goal is to create a subconscious hierarchy in the audience’s mind using preattentive elements, where information associated with blue is of higher importance, while information associated with red is of maximum importance. I also use other elements, like size and boldness, to further differentiate important elements. By doing this, and using preattentive principles, I should hopefully be able to focus my audience’s attention where I want it to be (Knaflic, 2015).</p>
        <p>The final element of my current site I’d like to note is a simple return to top function.</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture4.png" alt="A picture of the return to top button">

        <p>It may seem insignificant, but it’s one of many small touches that a truly successful website requires to thrive, along with the many unseen elements like semantic markup and micro formatting (the latter I have come to appreciate more using Zotero). The biggest part of making these elements work in my new site is finding a way to make them fit the site’s aesthetic, because while it is easy to take my old work and repurpose it, those solutions aren’t always perfect. I need to find new implementations, ones that fit my new site in both form and function if I want to truly get the most out of this process.</p>
        <h3>What I want to do:</h3>
        <p>The first idea I have, which I meant to include in the first submission but simply ran out of time for, is the ability to jump between sections/posts in my blog.</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture5.png" alt="A diagram showing the proposed back to top function">

        <p>This would allow first time visitors to have an uninterrupted reading experience, while those who want to access a specific post could find what they’re looking for quickly. I also plan on including a list of articles at the top, which could be used to jump to selections quickly. The reason why I’m keeping to the linear format is because I want to have my blogs play out in the specific order to show my growth as a student, and by having all blogs visible and able to be read in order, I can tell the story of that growth far more effectively. On top of all that, I also need to make a separate setup for mobile, since the screen is generally too small for mobile. So, I need to come up with a second solution -possibly based off what I did for my essays last assignment- for allowing ease of use on mobile. </p>
        <p>The next area for addition is my data art.</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture6.jpg" alt="A mockup of the data art">

        <p>At this point I have a clear idea of what I want to do, although I’ll admit I may be a little over ambitious since I’m not sure exactly how to do it. In short, I want to show the sky being blotted out by satellites, with users being able to look in all directions to see the effects of this, to provoke thought about how humanity is already ruining our next step to the stars by being callous now. The main point though is that I will need to give A. enough information to let the user know how to interact with the art and B. an experience that works and is responsive across all device types.</p>
        <p>The last area for addition is my learning page, which is the one page I haven’t started beyond a place holder.</p>

        <img src="../multimedia/Essay2images/Picture7.jpg" alt="A picture of the site's top bar">

        <p>My plan for my design page is to create something eye catching and engaging. The problem is that my aesthetic for the rest of the site has backed this section into a corner. The background, for one, means that the entire site needs to be built around readability against black, which is usually harder than readability against white. My NASA inspired palette also poses some issues since Red is currently being used as a highlight colour. This could potentially become an accessibility problem down the line since 7-10% of men alone are red-green colour blind (‘Color Blindness Facts & Statistics: Prevalence’, no date). This means it’s something I need to be aware of, especially with such a muted palette (Knaflic, 2015: 122). I also need to use the correct visuals for each type of data, but that’s something I’ll be able to get a better feel for once I start my work properly.</p>
