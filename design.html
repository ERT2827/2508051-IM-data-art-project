        <h2>Welcome to the design page</h2>
        <p>It's a little rough so far, but I'm confident that with just a little time I'll have something rather competent</p>

        <h3>Initial design and goals</h3>
        <p>Unlike my previous site, where I was largely operating blind the whole time, I now have a fair bit more experience making websites. With that in mind, here are some of my main goals for this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start stronger: I had touched HTML briefly once in my life before this year. Now I have a semesters worth of experience to work from. So that means keeping up the same standard, and improving on it as I master new skills.</li>
            <li>Don't waste time repeating things: I have a whole library of experiences and functions to work from going into this project, which I plan on putting to good use to save me time and allow me to put the bulk of my focus on learning D3 and dealing with the NASA API.</li>
            <li>Do better planning: as mentioned, I didn't exactly know what I was doing last semester, and now I do. So that means I can go in with a far more comprehensive idea about what I am actually doing with myself this semester.</li>
            <li>Learn a lot: API's are the backbone of a great deal of web development, and this course serves as an excellent way to learn them so that I can utilize them in both future personal and professional projects.</li>
            <li>Have fun with space: Space is really cool, and I do my best work when I'm passionate about the topic. So, I'm going to be sure to embrace the inherent fun of this assignment both thematically for my site and for myself, with the goal of using that passion to output the best possible final product. Because, come on. We're working with NASA. That's cool no matter how you look at it.</li>
