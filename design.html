        <h2>Welcome to the design page</h2>
        <p>This is where I will be discussing the design and philosophy of this website in depth.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="readingSection">
        <h3>Initial design and goals</h3>
        <p>Unlike my previous site, where I was largely operating blind the whole time, I now have a fair bit more experience making websites. With that in mind, here are some of my main goals for this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start stronger: I had touched HTML briefly once in my life before this year. Now I have a semesters worth of experience to work from. So that means keeping up the same standard, and improving on it as I master new skills.</li>
            <li>Don't waste time repeating things: I have a whole library of experiences and functions to work from going into this project, which I plan on putting to good use to save me time and allow me to put the bulk of my focus on learning D3 and dealing with the NASA API.</li>
            <li>Do better planning: as mentioned, I didn't exactly know what I was doing last semester, and now I do. So that means I can go in with a far more comprehensive idea about what I am actually doing with myself this semester.</li>
            <li>Learn a lot: API's are the backbone of a great deal of web development, and this course serves as an excellent way to learn them so that I can utilize them in both future personal and professional projects.</li>
            <li>Keep better practices: My old code is kind of a mess, which is more due to my own laziness than anything. I plan on annotating this code better and commiting to certain practices like only using Var for the sake of keeping my code cleaner and making it easier to go back to, instead of having to relearn it every time I take a week off to focus on another project.</li>
            <li>Have fun with space: Space is really cool, and I do my best work when I'm passionate about the topic. So, I'm going to be sure to embrace the inherent fun of this assignment both thematically for my site and for myself, with the goal of using that passion to output the best possible final product. Because, come on. We're working with NASA. That's cool no matter how you look at it.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="readingSection">
        <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
        <h3>Core principles:</h3>
        <p>My main guiding statement for this project as I go forwards is this: <span class="highlightedText">Capture the wonder of space.</span></p>
        <p>This immediately gives me a solid starting point for my design, since there are a great many websites that focus on space out there already, and because of that I'm able to draw upon them for reference when building my own site. The most obvious starting point amidst these is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's own website. </p>
        <img src="multimedia\NASAPage.png" alt="A picture of the NASA website">
        <p>NASA has a good website, although I need to acknowledge that its focus is very different to mine. The big difference is that NASA has an extremely broad set of focuses, from sattelites to Space Shuttles to the environment, while my site is purely going to be concerned with the movements of sattelites. This narrows my scope somewhat, so I will narrow my scope and adjust my parameters accordingly.</p>
        <p>So, that gives me a goal: Create a site that is easily readable, but still satisfies that awe that space and its wonders is known to inspire.</p>
        <p>The first step towards doing this, for me, was deciding on core design elements. My font, my color scheme, the basic layout and the readability of my information.</p>
        <ul>
            <img src="multimedia/Text Sample.png" alt="An image showing the font style of my site.">
            <li>For my font, I went with a style called Ubuntu. It's a strong Sans Serif font that is close to the font NASA uses on their site. Truth be told, I'm considering switching it for the exact font Nasa uses, but that's only a thought right now since I'm still happy with this font.</li>'
            <img src="multimedia/colorScheme.jpg" alt="A selection of swatches">
            <li>I believe a strong color scheme is key to the design of a website, especially one that is consistently used. It allows the viewer to quickly and easily categorize information, reducing processing time and increasing understanding. It's almost like doing the mental heavy lifting for the user. Because of that, I plan on using two main colors to highlight information. Blue backgrounds are to be used when important information is being presented on its own, while red will be used to highlight important information which is part of a larger section. I chose this color scheme because it matches NASA's, adding more to the theme and aesthetic of the site. This is with the understanding that the usage of Red could exclude colorblind users.</li>
            <img src="multimedia/Basic ideas.jpg" alt="Very basic samples for each page on the site.">
            <li>My site is going to use a largely homogenized layout, both to maintain consistency and ease of use, as well as reducing dev load due to the relatively small scope of this site. Having the basic ideas down so soon is still a major win for this site though, since it means that far less time is spent agonizing over site decisions.</li>
            <img src="multimedia/Knaflic.png" alt="A screenshot from 'Storytelling with Data' by Knaflic.">
            <li>A big focus with this project is providing interesting information in a readable manner, and there is perhaps no bigger tool for this than the reading "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Knaflic. The book provides a useful outline about how one can go about presenting data in a way that is readable and interesting. It's extremely useful to have that kind of information available as a resource, since while I do feel as though I'm observant enough to somewhat understand how other sites present their information, seeing an actual guide to the concepts involved with storytelling using data in an easily readable format is a massively useful tool to have.</li>
        </ul>
